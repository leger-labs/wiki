**The easiest way to run fully featured, battery-included Open WebUI sessions in the cloud.**

Leger gives teams a managed, scalable platform to collaborate, deploy, and ship Open WebUI sessions, MCP servers, and AI agent workflows — all from a single platform.

Leger Labs is building the infrastructure layer for hosted, collaborative Open WebUI. We believe that teams should be able to deploy and share powerful LLM workflows in the cloud — without wrestling with infrastructure or local hardware limitations.

We support builders using open-source LLMs, custom models, and edge-oriented compute. Whether you're building in research, production, or rapid iteration — Leger helps you scale, collaborate, and deploy with confidence.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to make local-first AI interfaces like Open WebUI as easy to deploy and collaborate on as cloud-native tools.

We envision a future where LLM workflows are:

- **Portable** – deploy across environments with ease  
- **Transparent** – audit and improve models confidently  
- **Team-Friendly** – share workflows and sessions like documents  

We're here to ensure these workflows aren't locked behind closed APIs or heavyweight DevOps.

## What We Do

At Leger, we help teams:

- Launch and manage Open WebUI sessions in the cloud
- Deploy and share custom LLM agents and workflows
- Collaborate on live AI environments with zero infra overhead
- Work with open-source and local-first tools at scale

Our platform empowers developers to focus on building, not managing infrastructure.
We're proud sponsors of the [Open WebUI project](https://github.com/orgs/agency-agency/sponsoring) since January 2025 — and we intend to keep supporting it as contributors and champions.

## Backed by

We're backed by partners who believe in building foundational developer tools:

## A Note on Independence

Leger Labs, Inc. is not affiliated with Open WebUI, Inc.

We're a small, technical founding team focused on getting the foundations right — and scaling with discipline. We've been profitable since day one and intend to keep running Leger the way we started: product-first, user-first, and infrastructure-light.

Let's work on the landing/marketing page information for leger.run
I have attached three repositories to this prompt, leger is the actual repo where i added some thoughts on what we're building but much more from a technical/engineering perspective; wiki is the landing page which we will work on; and as an aside you can quickly go thorugh mecattaf/notes where i compiled some notes i had (from months ago).

in leger-labs/leger you will find some key files such as index.md in contents/docs corresponds to the landing page, where you will find a lot of lorem ipsum text.
instead of that i want to have strong statements like:
* "one chat interface to rule them all"
* "chat with your ai agents in God mode"
there are feature cards as well which are currently also placeholders: those will redirect to the docs section (cards need to be made clickable).

one piece that is not clear is the pricing: it's $99/month (not seat dependent); as well as variable enterprise plans for which we will not indicate the pricing just yet.

i have a large openwebui features json where i categorized and grouped together some of the 350+ openwebui environment variables. im ny own docs, i will not speak to each variable but rather these "bundles" of environment variables that constitute features. the reason for my building leger product in the first place was that the average user (even technical ones) did not have the time to set up OWUI to actually make use of all its power. i m preparing a report on this right now and will prpvide you with it in the next prompt.

# Leger + Agency: Technical Product Positioning

## Core Message

**Leger**: Deploy OpenWebUI in 5 minutes. Manage 350+ configuration variables through simple interfaces.

**Agency**: Open-source framework for replicating any AI agent. Never pay for another "GPT wrapper" again.

**Together**: Complete AI infrastructure + unlimited agent creation = end of SaaS AI sprawl.

---

## The Technical Reality

### What OpenWebUI Actually Is

Not just "self-hosted ChatGPT" but a complete AI orchestration platform:

1. **Multi-model gateway** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, HuggingFace)
2. **Pipeline processor** (chain operations, filters, transformations)  
3. **Tool framework** (MCP servers, function calling, code execution)
4. **RAG system** (vector search, reranking, citation generation)
5. **Workflow engine** (conditional logic, parallel processing)

### What Leger Solves

OpenWebUI configuration complexity:
- **Web search alone**: 18 environment variables
- **RAG setup**: 45+ variables  
- **Voice configuration**: 25+ variables
- **Model routing**: 30+ variables
- **Total**: 350+ configuration points

Leger reduces this to ~15 business decisions.

### What Agency Enables

Replicate any commercial AI service:
```python
# Perplexity clone in 50 lines
class PerplexityAgent(Agent):
    tools = ["web_search", "document_search", "citation_generator"]
    
# v0 clone in 75 lines  
class V0Agent(Agent):
    tools = ["component_generator", "preview_renderer", "shadcn_library"]
    
# Julius clone in 60 lines
class JuliusAgent(Agent):
    tools = ["jupyter_kernel", "data_viz", "statistical_analysis"]
```
